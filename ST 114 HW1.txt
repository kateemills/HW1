Instructions: Please edit this file by typing answers below. You will then "push" the file onto	your github.ncsu.edu repository. We will go over how to do this in the first lab.
Question 1: Why did you decide to major in statistics?
	I took AP stat in high school and really enjoyed it. I enjoy math and need to learn more about computer programming.
Question 2: What do you hope to do once you graduate?
	I hope to go into a career using stat to help save the environment and help find new ways to conserve our natural resources. I would love to be able to do this at SAS.
Question 3: What do you hope to learn in the class?
	I am going to work hard to learn the basics of computer programming and how it can be used to help me compute statistics on my data.
Question 4: Do you have any concerns about this class that you'd like to share?
	I do not have a very extensive background in computer programming so this class might be hard for me to get the hang of in the begining.
Question 5: Tell us about yourself. Just a sentence or two is fine.
	I love nature and dogs. I’m from Raleigh, I’ve played soccer all my life and I’m super excited to be attending state this fall!
